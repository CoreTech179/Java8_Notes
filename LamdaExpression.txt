Basically lamda Expression is a anonymous function 
That means, It doesn't have any return type, method name and also don't have a access modifier

Steps to make any method a lamda expression are
1. Remove access modifier
2. Remove return type
3. Remove method name
4. place arrow

i.e. Example

public void sayHello(){
    System.out.println("hello");
}

therefore, equivalent lamda expression is = 

() -> {
    System.out.println("Hello");
}
