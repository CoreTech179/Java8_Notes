The features of Java 8 are

1. Lamda expression --> They are similar to methods but they do not need a name and they can be implemented
    right in the body of a method.
    ex. (x,y) -> x + y

2. Stream API --> It is used for bulk data operations on the Collection frameworks

3. Date and Time API

4. Built-in Base64 Encoding and Decoding functions are introduced in Java.util.Base64

5. :: Operator (i.e. Method reference and constructor reference)

6. Default and Static methods introduced inside Interface

7. Functional Interface --> A functional Interface is an Interface that has exactly one abstract method.
